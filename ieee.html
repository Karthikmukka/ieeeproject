	<p id="hometext">The IEEE Student Branch (Branch Code STB 31231) of this institute was formed in 1993 in the spirit of providing students resources and contacts needed for the enhancement of their professional development. It provides technical competitions, tours of cutting-edge facilities and a venue to meet and speak with some of the most important working professionals. It is intended to provide a platform for students to display as well as enhance their skills. IEEE membership provides many programs and presents yet another chance for students to stay a step ahead on the path to their chosen fields. The branch hopes to create an environment where all students can learn to effectively develop and use technology both for improving their own career prospects and for the benefit of humanity. It has been playing an effective role in shaping and developing responsible Engineers to the world in general and to the country in particular. It has been conducting regular training programs like group workshops, seminars, contests, industrial visits and a lot more. This website contains a record of all the activities of the Student Branch.</p>
